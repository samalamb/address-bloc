# address_bloc

Address Bloc was a project used to better understand how to create Ruby Programs. The project also gave me exposure to the Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB). IRB is able to preform anyting a regular Ruby document can do, such as create variables, do simple arithmetic, and create an instance of a Ruby document to be executed. Address Bloc also introduced me to RSpec a means to test the code that is being written. The final product is able to create an Adress Book with user input with a name, phone number and email.
